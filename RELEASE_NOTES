A new version of Utils is out. Constructors of static classes are now private. nette/utils was removed from dependencies so this package now has no dependencies. Return type of method TCollection::fromArray was changed from self to static (technically it is a BC break but the expected impact is minimal/none).

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
